# hall3d assets

This folder is intentionally empty (placeholders-first workflow).

## Character (Mixamo recommended)

Put a Mixamo-rigged GLB here:

- `character.glb`
  - Should include at least `Idle` and `Walk` (or similarly named) animations.

If `character.glb` is missing, the 3D hall will fall back to a simple capsule placeholder.
